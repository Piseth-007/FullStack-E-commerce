## Project Structure

```text
src/
|- api/            Axios API client
|- components/     Shared, storefront, and admin components
|- context/        Authentication, cart, store settings, toast, and confirmation state
|- hooks/          Shared resource and theme hooks
`- pages/          Storefront, authentication, and admin pages
```

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm
- The Laravel backend running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

The frontend API client uses `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` as its base URL. Update `src/api/axios.js` if the backend uses another host or port.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will print the local URL, normally `http://localhost:5173`.

## Main Routes

### Storefront

- `/` - Home page
- `/products` - Product listing
- `/products/:id` - Product details
- `/categories` - Category listing
- `/brands` - Brand listing
- `/about` - About page
- `/contact` - Contact page using the configured store details
- `/cart` - Shopping cart
- `/checkout` - Authenticated checkout
- `/orders` - Authenticated order history
- `/orders/:id` - Authenticated order details
- `/favorites` - Authenticated favorites
- `/profile` - Authenticated profile

### Authentication

- `/login`
- `/register`
- `/forgot-password`
- `/reset-password`
- `/admin/login`
- `/admin/forgot-password`

Customer and admin authentication pages render without the storefront Navbar and Footer. Login, registration, and recovery screens share the responsive split image/form layout with animated transitions between auth states.

### Administration

- `/admin/dashboard`
- `/admin/products`
- `/admin/categories`
- `/admin/brands`
- `/admin/orders`
- `/admin/contacts`
- `/admin/reviews`
- `/admin/settings`

Admin routes require an authenticated administrator account.

## Store Settings

Administrators can update the store name, logo, contact email, phone number, address, Bakong payment credentials, and notification preferences from `/admin/settings`.

Store identity and contact information are exposed through the public `GET /api/settings/store` endpoint and displayed by the storefront Navbar, Footer, and Contact page. The storefront falls back to the default Botaniq details while the request is loading or unavailable.

## Theme and Notifications

The light/dark theme is controlled from the storefront or admin Navbar and persisted in `localStorage`. The admin sidebar and Navbar provide order notifications, contact/review counts, low-stock alerts, and direct links to the relevant records.
